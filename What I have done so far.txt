What I have done so far:
Week1:
1. Change the dropdown button into "A -> B / C _ D"
2. After clicking "Add Rule", "A -> B / C _ D" will appear instead of the dropdown button
3. After clicking A, B, C or D, and then click on an y IPA, A, B, C or D will change into that IPA (The most difficult work done so far)

Week2:
1. Buttons can be used to type 
(But only one can be typed, only one UR, and original tag will be removed after switching.)
