A --> B / C _ D


CAD --> CBD

A =/= B
A and B cannot be null at the same time.
C and D can be null

A, B, C, D
can be
- segments ("letters"): a, b, k ... x ... all are here: http://www.ipachart.com
- boundaries (#)
- "features" [+feature] or [-feature] or no feature
e.g. [+round] --> [+high] / _ #
- C, V

Next steps:
- The user should be able to enter any segment (symbol from the consonant and vowel table) in the rule, and the program should know what to do.
- Make the program understand what C and V are.
- Make “Remove rule” work
- Empty should be nothing.
- A, B, C, D should be lighter font, to distinguish C from C = consonant.
- Ability to enter UR (Underlying Representation) from tables. 
- A, B, C, D and URs can also be typed (in addition to clicking).

Next steps:
[most imporant] - The user should be able to enter any segment (symbol from the consonant and vowel table) in the rule [done], and the program should know what to do. [to do]

- Make “Remove rule” work [after you have changed a rule or derived something]
- Ability to enter UR (Underlying Representation) from tables. [works only until you type in the box, to be fixed later]

The way rules work
A —> B / C _ D
search for sequences CAD
then map A —> B
Problem:
A —> B / A _ 
search for sequences AA
then map second A —> B
so, for AAAAA, it should be mapped to ABBBB, not ABABA
This is because all A’s are first selected, and then changed at the same time. The rules are not iterative, or cyclical. 
For the sequence A1A2A3A4A5, first mark all sequences of A’s: A1A2, A2A3, A3A4, A4A5
Then map the second A in a squence to B, so: A1B, A2B, A3B, A4B, or combined ABBBB

p —> k / t _ s

tpsa —> tksa
tppsa —> tppsa

- Add “remove” box to all rules, including the first one, once you “add rule”
- Ability to enter UR (Underlying Representation) from tables. [works only until you type in the box, to be fixed later]]
- If the rule does not apply, make the row with the form empty. 
- Make the clicking on boxes easier.
- Add buttons with features, for instance
Button:
+ consonantal -
+ sonorant -
and so on (see table Feature chart)
then, the features appear as A B C D in the following format
[+consonantal +sonorant] is one segment
[+consonantal] [+sonorant] are two segments and you can have many segments

July 8
- B can be a feature, this doesn’t work right now
- [+ continuant] —> [continuant] as a button
- Test the rules.
- Remove affricates from the table (in the code).
