Next steps:
- The user should be able to enter any segment (symbol from the consonant and vowel table) in the rule, and the program should know what to do.
- Make the program understand what C and V are.
- Make “Remove rule” work
- Empty should be nothing.
- A, B, C, D should be lighter font, to distinguish C from C = consonant.
- Ability to enter UR (Underlying Representation) from tables. 
- A, B, C, D and URs can also be typed (in addition to clicking).
