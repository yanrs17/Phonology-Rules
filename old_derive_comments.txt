Example (hypothetical, but factually correct):
Mia: The segment ⱱ does not show properly. It appears as a box.

Liuba: 
PP - ɪmpʰasəbʰəl – aspirated the [b] even though that is not the rule – wrong surface form.
PP - Aspiration – doesn’t differentiate between  voiced and voiceless obstruents for aspiration – aspirates both voiced and voiceless sounds – strange because voiced obstruents are rarely aspirated and usually referred to as breathy voiced - doesn't work for English specifically.
- /ɪnɹevəɹent/ – could not find a rule that would makes this underlying representation into [ɪɹɹevəɹent] – nasal assimilation should work, but does not change it.
- Segment [θ] shows up as doubled when clicked once i.e. [θθ] 
- Segment [ʎ] doesn’t show up in the box when clicked on the IPA chart
- On IPA chart, have h ɦ, where h is “voiceless” and ɦ is “voiced”, but the final devoicing rule doesn’t change ɦ to h (might be nitpicky, but I wanted to mention that, I know they are both essentially voiceless)
PP - Sibilant Harmony – only assimilates to the majority – can’t control which sibilants assimilate to which sibilants without having a majority. i.e. /naʃsis/ becomes [nassis] but never [naʃʃiʃ], and /nasʃiʃ/ becomes [naʃʃiʃ] but never [nassis] (I found a derivation that was /naʃsis/ -> [naʃʃiʃ] but it cannot be replicated)
PP - Rounding Harmony - /ɶ/ -> [æ] instead of its unround counterpart [a]
PP - Dissimilation – doesn’t do anything to [+low] vowels, when its supposed to make them [-low] when close to a [+low] vowel
PP - Lenition – nothing happens to /g/ (even though it is [-sonorant +voice] and should change to [ɣ]
- Intervocalic Voicing – /h/ isn’t voiced to [ɦ] intervocalically
- Velar Palatalization – both /ʁ/ and /χ/ are palatalized to [ʝ] even though /χ/ is supposed to palatalize to [ç], the voice counterpart to [ʝ]
- Strengthening – /h/ doesn’t strengthen to [ʔ] (supposed to); /ʙ/ is [+continuant] because it’s a trill, but doesn’t strengthen to [b] (this is true for all 3 trills)

Vivian:
- (there is still the option where once you've deleted a rule, it's possible to delete all rules): when you first delete a rule with the checkbox there will be a box beside the first one as well, allowing you to delete all of the rules
- on the FAQ: consider reformatting the rule list (the roman numerals format is understandable but a little messy) or add a blank return between rules
- don't remember if we talked about it but hiatus resolution is iterative (toiel -> tol) 
- hiatus resolution applies for all multiples of vowels in the word (baataabaa -> bataba) whereas final vowel deletion only affects the last word of the input
- tested all vowels for final vowel deletion
- θ pastes twice (θθ) from the keyboard
- when you highlight and input from the keyboard (should get rid of all characters except for the one clicked) it adds to existing characters in the box
- postnasal voicing: ɬ is not voiced to ɮ (not sure if it should be), but in any case ɬ remains the same after nasals.
-postnasal voicing: all nasals tested with all voiceless consonants, only issue is the above point
- nasal place assimilation applies to all nasals in the word: ɴɱmd -> ɱmnd starting from the right
PP - Final coronal deletion: ɾ does not delete word finally (I can't find anywhere to confirm that it's a coronal, but it is pronounced with the tip of the tongue, right?), and out of all the retroflex only ɳ deletes. ʈɖɽʐʂɻɭ do not delete.
PP - Height Harmony: applies vacuously to [-high, -low] vowels but not to [-low] vowels. Otherwise, all tested [+high] vowels correspond to their mid position (including roundedness).
- l-vocalization seems to function as should, as does initial stress assignment.
PPP - Final devoicing: weird problem where if the first UR ends in anything but a stop (such as "bran" or "braj"), the rest of the URs don't process. Seems to only function when the end of the first UR is an obstruent.

Fernanda: The dissimilation rule does not apply properly. 
- Question: Is sibilant harmony suppose to apply to ʂ ʐ ç and ʝ when they appear before s? PJ: Good point!

Mia:
PP - Voicing Assimilation: Doesn’t apply to /ɦ/, /h/, /ɬ/ or /ɮ/. When either one of these are before a [-son] they do not assimilate in voicing. When either one follows a [-son] the preceding [-son] does not assimilate to the voicing of the listed consonants. The rule correctly applied to all other [-son] consonants.
PP - L-Vocalization: changes /l/ —>/o/ before /j/ (our chart has /j/ as [-con]
- Checked the following (all worked correctly):
Word-Final Consonant Neutralization
Vowel Reduction
Nasal Assimilation
PP - The /ɶ/ and/œ/ buttons produce the same character (/œ/) though they contain different features (Ex. Height harmony will correctly only apply  to /ɶ/ not /ɶ/)
- These also all seem to work correctly:
Intervocalic Voicing
Schwa Epenthesis
High Voel Epenthesis
Metathesis

Peter:
PPP - Remove “We expect to be able to release the alpha version sometime in Fall 2016.” in the About page.
